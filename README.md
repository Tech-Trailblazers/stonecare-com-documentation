# 🏔️ StoneCare SDS / MSDS Documentation

> “Protect your surfaces — and people — with transparency.”

Welcome to the **StoneCare SDS / MSDS Documentation** repository! This is a community-driven effort to collect, organize, and share Safety Data Sheets (SDS / MSDS) and related safety resources for **StoneCare / Stone Care International** products. Our mission is to make chemical safety info more accessible, usable, and beneficial — for homeowners, educators, developers, emergency responders, and curious minds alike.

## 📘 What Are SDS / MSDS?

Safety Data Sheets (SDS, historically MSDS) are standardized documents produced by manufacturers to provide critical information about chemical products. They typically include:

- 🧬 **Composition & Ingredients** — what’s inside
- ⚠️ **Hazards & Warnings** — what to watch out for
- 🚑 **First Aid & Emergency Measures** — what to do if exposure occurs
- 🔥 **Fire / Stability / Reactivity Data** — how it behaves under stress
- 🧴 **Handling & Storage Guidelines** — how to use safely
- 🧯 **Spill / Disposal Procedures** — what to do with leftover or waste

StoneCare publishes SDS for many of its stone care products (cleaners, sealers, polishes, etc.). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} For example, their _Granite & Stone Polish-5184_ SDS is available. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} They also provide SDS for stain removers and sealers. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

StoneCare’s SDS / safety documents exist, but they’re often spread across product pages, in PDF form, or hard to search. This repository helps:

- **Centralize** all available SDS / safety docs in one place
- **Organize** them, making lookup easier
- **Enable usage** in education, tools, apps, research, and emergencies
- **Open contribution** so the community can help expand, correct, or translate

By making safety data more visible and usable, we empower people to make safer decisions and respond better in accidents or exposures.
